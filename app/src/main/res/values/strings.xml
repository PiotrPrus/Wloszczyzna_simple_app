    <string name="wloszczyzna_main_text">Wloszczyzna is an alternative to local bars with pizza, which is dripping with grease,
        and the ingredients are lost in the sough like a sponge. Here such  a thing doesn\'t exist. It is very properly made and tasty pizza.
        Founded by three friends who studied together, their small pizzeria is open in Morena, Gdansk.
